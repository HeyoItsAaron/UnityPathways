# Unity Pathways Projects
## A repo for all the little required projects in the 5 Unity Pathways courses..

This repository is essentially storage for small projects I complete as I take the Unity Pathways courses on learn.unity.com. I have a few game projects going at the moment and I think that the best way to beef up my resume is to complete these small courses so I can earn the badges and have something to show for while I continue to make progress on my games.
